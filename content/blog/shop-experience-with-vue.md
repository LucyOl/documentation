# Building API first shop experiences with Vue.js 

A modern eCommerce system is both, tailored to the needs of the visitor and the maintainer of the shop. A good shop UX alone is not sufficient if shipping processes or managing customer requests are annoying. [IONOS Agency Partner](https://www.ionos.com/agency-partner) Fruchtec is specialized on building state of the art eCommerce experiences. [Fruchtec](https://www.fruchtec.de/) combines a set of specialized services for a shop experience that feels smooth for their clients and their client's clients. 

## A good shop experience defined

> "Buying an item or service online has to feel like visiting a good restaurant. You enter and want to be greeted nicely. The offer is presented to you and you are guided through the location. You see and understand the products, but nothing is forced upon you. No artificial scarcity, no time pressure. And of course the service doesn't end with the order. You have a good feeling that the deliveries will arrive on time. You know who to contact for questions and if you don't like a product that's no problem." - Jonas, Co-founder Fruchtec

Fruchtec views themselves as the construction company and the fitter of the restaurant, whereas their clients have to maintain and run the location. The objective is to allways make a buyer feel comfortable, along his entire customer journeys. For many of Fruchtec's clients, this also involves offline locations. Customers can view items physically before buying them online or reserving them online and picking them up in the store. Even if a client does not run a physical store, all of them have warehouses. 

Auch wenn es keinen Offlinehandel gibt hat jeder ein lager, auf das prozesse angepasst werden m√ºssen
